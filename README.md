Leetcode solutions, because why only trust leetcode with them?

The useful feature of putting these here, however is that other
people can view, fork, fix and pull request my stupid mistakes.

To that end, I will be adding test cases to the best of my ability. I don't know how many I will have that are hidden behind the submission functionality of leetcode, I will just try to grab them when I hit edge cases.

Please help me if you see a dunce move
